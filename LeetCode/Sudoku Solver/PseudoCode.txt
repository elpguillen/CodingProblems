1. Passes in partially filled Sudoku board
2. Call backtrack function:
    a. If cell filled, skip
    b. if cell not filled, try all numbers between 1 and N (where N is length/width/size of the board)
    c. if number is valid recurse deeper into the grid
    d. if reach a dead-end, undo and continue backtrack with value yet tried
3. For any valid Sudoku puzzle backtracking will eventually fill all cells correctly.
